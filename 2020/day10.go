	// Solve Part 2. Could have done both parts in the same loop, but doing it

	// submission on the Advent of Code site.
	//
	// We use DP to solve part 2, because backtracking would be O(2^n). We want to
	// know how many arrangements there are for jolt i. The answer to this is the
	// sum of how many arragements there are for jolts i-1, i-2, and i-3. Not all
	// of these exist due to the input, but at least one of these exist (otherwise
	// we could not solve this puzzle). We do bottom-up DP with the base case that
	// there is 1 way to make 0 jolts, which is just the charging outlet.
	//
	// E.g., to figure out how many arrangments there are for 6 jolts (because you
	// have a 6 jolt adapter), sum the arrangements for 5, 4, and 3 jolts. You
	// would have calculated this from a previous step (if any of them don't
	// exist, their values would be 0, which is fine).
